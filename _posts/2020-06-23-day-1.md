  title: On the use and interpretation of neural attention mechanisms for biomedical natural language processing
  abstract: "Attention mechanisms allow neural networks to “focus” on particular units of input (e.g., specific words or sentences) to inform predictions. Incorporation of attention has been shown to improve model predictive performance for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Attention mechanisms also often touted (implicitly or explicitly) as affording interpretability: for a given output one can inspect the inputs to which the model assigned comparatively large attention weights. In this talk I will discuss a few specific attentive neural architectures designed for problems in health informatics, broadly construed. Model interpretability is a key consideration in this domain; I will therefore also present empirical work that interrogates properties of attention weights to ascertain whether they afford transparency. I will discuss that while attention does consistently improve predictive performance, its use as a means of providing model interpretability is questionable."

  title: "Text mining student discussion forum data: common pitfalls and how to avoid them"
  abstract: "The widespread use of online discussion forums in educational settings provides a rich source of data for researchers interested in how collaboration and interaction can foster effective learning. Natural language processing and machine learning techniques allow discussion forum texts to be analysed in an automated, efficient way. Here, we present our findings related to the robustness and generalisability of automated text classification methods in common use (Farrow et al., 2019). We closely examined one published state-of-the-art model, comparing different approaches to (a) managing unbalanced classes in the data, and (b) selecting a suitable data set to use for evaluation. By demonstrating how commonly-used data preprocessing practices can lead to over-optimistic results, we contributed to the development of the field so that the results of automated content analysis can be used with confidence."

  title: Towards an Emoji WordNet
  abstract: "Emoji are used with increasing frequency to convey meaning and tone in digital communication. They present a unique challenge to natural language processing resources as they are used to convey semantic content, but are not part of traditional semantic resources. The most popular semantic resource for English is Princeton WordNet , which provides a semantic categorisation of words into sets of semantically equivalent synonyms, or ‘synsets’. WordNet was developed before the advent of emoji and does not contain any links to emoji. It would be highly beneficial to a number of applications that already use WordNet as part of their semantic processing pipelines to have the meanings conveyed by emoji mapped to synsets in WordNet as this would allow a deeper understanding of texts that contain emoji. This integration would also provide an extra feature source for machine learning pipelines that use emoji. In the remainder of this abstract, we will first demonstrate some of the lexical properties of emoji that make them suitable for integration into WordNet. We will then describe an annotation exercise, whereby we identified the senses of 20 common emoji. Finally, we will describe our intended future direction of research to attain our goal of full integration of emoji into WordNet."

  title: "Coping with large-scale terminology in a virtual patient dialogue system"
  abstract: "Joint work with Sophie Rosset, CNRS, Paris<p>

Virtual patients are software or hardware simulators designed to train medical students on simulated clinical cases, thus lifting the constraints of training on real patients and the attached inconvenience for the patients. A dialogue-enabled virtual patient aims to let a medical student practice history-taking in a natural way with a patient avatar that answers the student's questions.  To handle a large variety of cases in multiple specialities, the dialogue system needs to cope with text and the associated large-scale vocabulary in three contexts&#58; (1) the clinical case created offline by a medical instructor, (2) the questions asked by the medical student (the learner), and (3) the answers generated by the system (the virtual patient) to respond to the student.  This requires term and concept mapping across these three contexts, which we address using knowledge-based and data-driven methods."

  title: Bespoke machine learning for humanoid robots
  abstract: "We are interested in developing humanoid robots with learning capabilities. Computation and memory  are typically limited on a robot and there are often requirements of tight real-time performance. Therefore we would like to design algorithms with guaranteed computational and memory bounds. We will show that we do not need to sacrifice much in terms of performance (e.g. recognition rates, accuracy, etc.). We will show practical examples in typical robotics applications such as in the estimation of the robot’s dynamics, on the fly object learning, and speech perception. Results come in different flavors as for example in dynamics estimation the controller has to potentially learn and provide estimates in the millisecond range while longer timescales are acceptable in e.g. visual object recognition. Speech recognition, on the other hand, requires integrating voice input over time. We will show implementations in some of our humanoid robots, namely the iCub and the recently developed R1 service robot."

  title: Statistical hypothesis testing in a Bayesian non-parametric framework
  abstract: "Nonparametric statistical tests have proved themselves important tools in modern data analysis, where the emergence of large data sets can support the relaxation of linearity or normality assumptions implicit in traditional methods. In this talk, I will introduce two Bayesian nonparametric procedures for independence and two-samples testing.  Well known advantages of having an explicit probability measure include the easy comparison of evidence across different studies, the inclusion of prior information, and the integration of results within formal decision analysis. The first approach consists of a tractable, explicit and analytic quantification of the relative evidence of dependence vrs independence, using Polya tree priors on the space of probability measures which can then be embedded within a decision theoretic test for dependence.  The second approach is based on the representation of probability measures in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) via the so-called kernel mean embeddings which provide a flexible framework for fully nonparametric hypothesis testing. In practice, the performance of these RKHS tests can be very sensitive to the choice of kernel and its lengthscale parameters. To address this central issue, I will discuss  a new probabilistic model for kernel mean embeddings combining a Gaussian process prior over the RKHS containing the mean embedding with a conjugate likelihood function, thus yielding a closed form posterior over the mean embedding."

  title: Predicting progression in heterogeneous neurodegenerative diseases using a joint mixture model approach
  abstract: "Many neurodegenerative diseases are heterogeneous both in their biology and clinical phenotypes. Identifying predictive factors for a given patient is of great clinical importance to predict individual disease progression. We developed a method, longitudinal joint cluster regression (L-JCR), to jointly estimate a predictive regression model and identify latent groups (or subtypes), which improves predictive performance. Longitudinal dynamics were modelled using a mixed effects model, and the model parameters and latent subtypes are jointly estimated via an expectation-maximization algorithm with embedded restricted maximum likelihood (REML) algorithm. The method handles high-dimensional covariates by making sparsity assumptions via lasso penalization. We applied our method to case studies in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's patients, as examples of heterogeneous neurodegenerative diseases with often very different progression profiles. We show that the accuracy of progression prediction improves when taking the group structure into account, and that the inferred latent groups are biologically meaningful."

  title: Statistical challenges in the analysis of single-cell gene expression data
  abstract: "Cell-to-cell gene expression variability in seemingly homogeneous cell populations plays a crucial role in tissue function and development. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) can characterise this variability in a genome-wide manner. However, the promise of scRNA-seq comes at the cost of higher data complexity. In particular, a prominent feature of scRNA-seq experiments is strong measurement error, reflected in technical dropouts and poor correlations between technical replicates. 

In this talk, I will describe some of the statistical challenges that arise in scRNA-seq experiments: from experimental design to downstream inference. I will also introduce BASiCS (Bayesian Analysis of Single Cell Sequencing data), a Bayesian framework which simultaneously performs data normalisation and differential expression tests between experimental conditions or cell types. In particular, I will describe how BASiCS extends traditional differential mean expression analyses to also highlight changes in transcriptional variability that are robust to technical artefacts and other confounding effects. Finally, I will illustrate the performance of our methods in the context of immune cell populations and discuss ongoing efforts to improve the scalability of our approach. "

  title: Flexible, wide-coverage normalisation of medical concept mentions
  abstract: "Locating information about medical concepts in huge document repositories is challenging, due to the wide range of ways in which each concept of interest may be mentioned in text. For example, biomedical articles tend include more technical language, often using terms derived from Greek or Latin (e.g., hypercholesterolemia, dyspnea, leukocytosis). In contrast, a more informal style is often adopted in clinical records, where dyspnea may be described using various different brief narrative phrases with different internal structures (e.g., respiratory difficulty, breathing difficulties, shortness of breath), or abbreviations (e.g., SOB). 

Given this variability, search systems should ideally allow concept-level search, rather than requiring users to try to enumerate the range of words and phrases that could potentially describe a concept in text. Existing domain-specific terminological resources can act as the starting point for this functionality, since they typically list a number of textual variants/synonyms for each concept. However, in practice, the range of variants that can appear in text is far larger than these manually curated synonym sets. 

To address this issue, normalisation methods aim to automatically assign a concept ID in a given domain-specific terminological resource to each concept appearing in text. Our HYPHEN normalisation method uses a pipeline of different techniques to generate variations of a concept mention in text, and tries to match these against existing synonyms listed in a target terminological resource. The techniques are as follows: Acronym/abbreviation expansion; Plural to singular conversion; Generation of English equivalents of Neoclassical compounds and vice versa; Syntactic variation generation; Synonym generation

The variants generated by each technique are used as input to the next technique in the pipeline; the method terminates when a match against a synonym in the target terminological resource is found. The pipeline accounts for the fact that several transformations of the original mention may be required to achieve a match in the resource (e.g., high WBC -> high white blood cell -> leukocytosis). Recent incorporation of fuzzy matching further boosts performance; if none of the above methods achieve a match, then approximate matches are considered. 

HYPHEN is very flexible, and is able to normalise a range of different concept types (e.g., disorders, treatments, anatomical concepts, genes) in different text types to different target terminological resources."

  title: Converting tweets into sequential data to detect depressed users
  abstract: "Microblogs, for example on Twitter, are platforms that online users express their feelings, thoughts, and activities. Some users publicly explain not only their health conditions but also mental illness on their profiles. These mental disorder expression can be mined to find which factors are associated with depressive symptoms. 
Building a supervised predictive model needs input data and outputs for the model to learn patterns. With social media datasets, especially users with depression are normally labelled at user-level, not labelled at post-level. This is a challenge to notice how a user changes their posting patterns between general and health messages. 
This brings in the interest of developing a predictive model that can provide the predictions of both user-level and individual post-level. Additionally, combining a set of predicted post-labels can simulate the patterns between general and health text. A technique suitable to develop this king of model is multiple instance learning. The model can learn from only a set of labelled bags/users instead of a set of individual instances/user-generated messages."
